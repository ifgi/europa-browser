Europa Linked Observation Browser
==============

NASA World Wind viewer for SOS observations.

This project is about a tool for displaying data in a 3D context hopefully allowing a better understanding of a phenomenon. The Europa Linked Observation Browser allows an user to display observation data comming from Sensor Observation Service structured as Linked Open Data following the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology.

The viewer is able to display at the same time up to 3 variables (i.e wind direction, wind speed, wind temperature) comming form the same SPARQL Endpoint on top of NASA World Wind. The user can query time periods and display the results animated and explore the data.
